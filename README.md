# Ark-Trend-Visualisation

## Pre-requisites

A `bigquery_service_account.json` file in the root directory (you should have gotten access to download this file together with the case).

Latest Node version (e.g. by running `nvm install --lts`).

## Getting Started

Open two terminal windows and run one command in each:

```bash
node server
```

```bash
npm run start
```

## Future improvements

* More graphs with more specific endpoints
* Further refinement of data to make loading time even shorter
* Break out the backend into separate files
* Add testing for the backend
